    "The RedPitaya is an affordable FPGA board with fast analog inputs and outputs. This makes it interesting also for quantum optics experiments. The software package PyRPL (Python RedPitaya Lockbox) is an implementation of many devices that are needed for optics experiments every day. The user interface and all high-level functionality is written in python, but an essential part of the software is hidden in a custom FPGA design (based on the official RedPitaya software version 0.95). While most users probably never want to touch the FPGA design, the Verilog source code is provided together with this package and may be modified to customize the software to your needs. "

If you plan to contribute to the repository, you should definitely read section 5 to get an idea of what this software package realy does, and where help is needed.

    "As soon as the code will have reached version 0.9.0.3 (high-level unitary tests implemented and passing, approx. end of May 2016), we will consider the master branch of the github repository as the stable pre-release version. The goal is that the master branch will guarantee functionality at all times. \n",
    "\n",
    "Any changes to the code, if they do not pass the unitary tests or have not been tested, are to be submitted as pull-requests in order not to endanger the stability of the master branch. We will briefly desribe how to properly submit your changes in that scenario. \n",
    "\n",
    "Let's say you already changed the code of your local clone of pyrpl. Instead of directly committing the change to the master branch, you should create your own branch. In the windows application of github, when you are looking at the pyrpl repository, there is a small symbol looking like a steet bifurcation in the upper left corner, that says \"Create new branch\" when you hold the cursor over it. Click it and enter the name of your branch \"leos development branch\" or similar. The program will automatically switch to that branch. Now you can commit your changes, and then hit the \"publish\" or \"sync\" button in the upper right. That will upload your changes so everyone can see and test them. \n",
    "\n",
    "You can continue working on your branch, add more commits and sync them with the online repository until your change is working. If the master branch has changed in the meantime, just click 'sync' to download them, and then the button \"update from master\" (upper left corner of the window) that will insert the most recent changes of the master branch into your branch. If the button doesn't work, that means that there are no changes available. This way you can benefit from the updates of the stable pre-release version, as long as they don't conflict with the changes you have been working on. If there are conflicts, github will wait for you to resolve them. In case you have been recompiling the fpga, there will always be a conflict w.r.t. the file 'red_pitaya.bin' (since it is a binary file, github cannot simply merge the differences you implemented). The best way to deal with this problem is to recompile the fpga bitfile after the 'update from master'. This way the binary file in your repository will correspond to the fpga code of the merged verilog files, and github will understand from the most recent modification date of the file that your local version of red_pitaya.bin is the one to keep. \n",
    "\n",
    "At some point, you might want to insert your changes into the master branch, because they have been well-tested and are going to be useful for everyone else, too. To do so, after having committed and synced all recent changes to your branch, click on \"Pull request\" in the upper right corner, enter a title and description concerning the changes you have made, and click \"Send pull request\". Now your job is done. I will review and test the modifications of your code once again, possibly fix incompatibility issues, and merge it into the master branch once all is well. After the merge, you can delete your development branch. If you plan to continue working on related changes, you can also keep the branch and send pull requests later on. If you plan to work on a different feature, I recommend you create a new branch with a name related to the new feature, since this will make the evolution history of the feature more understandable for others. Or, if you would like to go back to following the master branch, click on the little downward arrow besides the name of your branch close to the street bifurcation symbol in the upper left of the github window. You will be able to choose which branch to work on, and to select master. \n",
    "\n",
    "Let's all try to stick to this protocol. It might seem a little complicated at first, but you will quikly appreciate the fact that other people's mistakes won't be able to endanger your working code, and that by following the commits of the master branch alone, you will realize if an update is incompatible with your work."

One can see that the trigger was not activated by the constant signal of 0 at the beginning, since it did not cross the hysteresis interval. One can also see a 'bug': After setting up the asg, it outputs the first value of its data table until its waveform output is triggered. For the halframp signal, as it is implemented in pyrpl, this is the maximally negative value. However, we passed the argument start_phase=90 to the asg.setup function, which shifts the first point by a quarter period. Can you guess what happens when we set start_phase=180? You should try it out!\n",

The integrator is responsible for the constant decrease rate at the beginning, and the low-pass that smoothens the asg waveform a little. One can also foresee that, if we are not paying attention, too large an integrator gain will quickly saturate the outputs. "

    "Again, what do we see? We set up the pid module with a constant (positive) input from the ASG. We then turned on the integrator (with negative gain), which will inevitably lead to a slow drift of the output towards negative voltages (blue trace). We had set the integral value above the positive saturation voltage, such that it takes longer until it reaches the negative saturation voltage. The output of the pid module is bound to saturate at +- 1 Volts, which is clearly visible in the green trace. The value of the integral is internally represented by a 32 bit number, so it can practically take arbitrarily large values compared to the 14 bit output. You can set it within the range from +4 to -4V, for example if you want to exloit the delay, or even if you want to compensate it with proportional gain. "

This is done by demodulating the device output (=network analyzer input) with the same sine that was used for the excitation and a corresponding cosine, lowpass-filtering, and averaging the two quadratures for a well-defined number of cycles. From the two quadratures, one can extract the magnitude and phase shift of the device's transfer function at the probed frequencies. Let's illustrate the behaviour. For this example, you should connect output 1 to input 1 of your RedPitaya, such that we can compare the analog transfer function to a reference.

    "Sometimes it is interesting to realize even more complicated filters. This is the case, for example, when a piezo resonance limits the maximum gain of a feedback loop. For these situations, the IIR module can implement filters with 'Infinite Impulse Response' (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infinite_impulse_response). It is the your task to choose the filter to be implemented by specifying the complex values of the poles and zeros of the filter. In the current version of pyrpl, the IIR module can implement IIR filters with the following properties:\n",
    "- strictly proper transfer function (number of poles > number of zeros)\n",
    "- poles (zeros) either real or complex-conjugate pairs\n",
    "- no three or more identical real poles (zeros)\n",
    "- no two or more identical pairs of complex conjugate poles (zeros)\n",
    "- pole and zero frequencies should be larger than $\\frac{f_\\rm{nyquist}}{1000}$ (but you can optimize the nyquist frequency of your filter by tuning the 'loops' parameter)\n",
    "- the DC-gain of the filter must be 1.0. Despite the FPGA implemention being more flexible, we found this constraint rather practical. If you need different behavior, pass the IIR signal through a PID module and use its input filter and proportional gain. If you still need different behaviour, the file iir.py is a good starting point. \n",
    "- total filter order <= 16 (realizable with 8 parallel biquads)\n",
    "- a remaining bug limits the dynamic range to about 30 dB before internal saturation interferes with filter performance\n",
    "\n",
    "Filters whose poles have a positive real part are unstable by design. Zeros with positive real part lead to non-minimum phase lag. Nevertheless, the IIR module will let you implement these filters. \n",
    "\n",
    "In general the IIR module is still fragile in the sense that you should verify the correct implementation of each filter you design. Usually you can trust the simulated transfer function. It is nevertheless a good idea to use the internal network analyzer module to actually measure the IIR transfer function with an amplitude comparable to the signal you expect to go through the filter, as to verify that no saturation of internal filter signals limits its performance.

Make sure that the peak-to-peak of the error signal coincides with the maximum voltages the RedPitaya can handle (-1 to +1 V if the jumpers are set to LV). This is important for getting optimal noise performance. If your signal is too low, amplify it. If it is too high, you should build a voltage divider with 2 resistors of the order of a few kOhm (that way, the input impedance of the RedPitaya of 1 MOhm does not interfere). \n",
    "\n",
    "Next, connect output 1 to the standard actuator at your hand, e.g. a piezo. Again, you should try to exploit the full -1 to +1 V output range. If the voltage at the actuator must be kept below 0.5V for example, you should make another voltage divider for this. Make sure that you take the input impedance of your actuator into consideration here. If you output needs to be amplified, it is best practice to put the voltage divider after the amplifier as to also attenuate the noise added by the amplifier. Hovever, when this poses a problem (limited bandwidth because of capacity of the actuator), you have to put the voltage divider before the amplifier. Also, this is the moment when you should think about low-pass filtering the actuator voltage. Because of DAC noise, analog low-pass filters are usually more effective than digital ones. A 3dB bandwidth of the order of 100 Hz is a good starting point for most piezos. \n",
    "\n",
    "You often need two actuators to control your cavity. This is because the output resolution of 14 bits can only realize 16384 different values. This would mean that with a finesse of 15000, you would only be able to set it to resonance or a linewidth away from it, but nothing in between. To solve this, use a coarse actuator to cover at least one free spectral range which brings you near the resonance, and a fine one whose range is 1000 or 10000 times smaller and who gives you lots of graduation around the resonance. The coarse actuator should be strongly low-pass filtered (typical bandwidth of 1Hz or even less), the fine actuator can have 100 Hz or even higher bandwidth. Do not get confused here: the unity-gain frequency of your final lock can be 10- or even 100-fold above the 3dB bandwidth of the analog filter at the output - it suffices to increase the proportional gain of the RedPitaya Lockbox. \n",

    "Pyrpl uses the Qt eventloop to perform asynchronous tasks, but it has been set as the default loop of `asyncio`, such that you only need to learn how to use the standard python module [`asyncio`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/asyncio.html), and you don't need to know anything about Qt. To give you a quick overview of what can be done, we present in the following block an exemple of 2 tasks running in parrallele. The first one mimicks a temperature control loop, measuring periodically a signal every 1 s, and changing the offset of an `asg` based on the measured value (we realize this way a slow and rudimentary software pid). In parrallele, another task consists in repeatedly shifting the frequency of an asg, and measuring an averaged spectrum on the spectrum analyzer.\n",
    "\n",
    "Both tasks are defined by coroutines (a python function that is preceded by the keyword `async`, and that can contain the keyword `await`). Basically, the execution of each coroutine is interrupted whenever the keyword `await` is encountered, giving the chance to other tasks to be executed. It will only be resumed once the underlying coroutine's value becomes ready.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally to execute the cocroutines, it is not enough to call `my_coroutine()`, since we need to send the task to the event loop. For that, we use the function `ensure_future` from the asyncio module. This function immediately returns an object that is not the result of the task (not the object that is behind `return` inside the coroutine), but rather a Future object, that can be used to retrieve the actual result once it is ready (this is done by calling `future.result()` latter on).\n",
    "\n",
    "If you are executing the code inside the ipython notebook, then, this is all you have to do, since an event loop is already running in the back (a qt eventloop if you are using the option %pylab qt). Otherwise, you have to use one of the functions (`LOOP.run_forever()`, `LOOP.run_until_complete()`, or `LOOP.run_in_executor()`) to launch the eventloop."
